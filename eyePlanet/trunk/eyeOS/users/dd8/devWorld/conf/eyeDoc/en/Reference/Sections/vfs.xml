	<desc>The vfs service is the layer that must be used to manipulate any file inside eyeOS. It contains two sets of functions to manipulate files: one thought to work with the user's abstract files, and the other one (having always a 'real_' prefix on their name) to work with normal, non-abstract files.</desc>
