The Home icon will open the eyeOS File Manager (also known as eyeFiles) with your home folder, which contains your personal files and documents.

From eyeFiles you can upload files from your computer to eyeOS, download files from eyeOS to your computer, and manage them (copying/pasting and renaming them, creating folders...).

You will also be able to launch some files which are recognized by eyeOS. This includes images, videos, text documents, compressed files, eyePackages (eyeOS Installable Packages) and more.

Please check the "The file manager" section for more information about eyeFiles and its usage.
