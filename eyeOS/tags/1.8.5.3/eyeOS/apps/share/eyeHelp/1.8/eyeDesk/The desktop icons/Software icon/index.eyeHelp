The Software icon will open the Applications folder, where you will be able to launch every installed application. Note that the system may have Applications installed that won't appear in eyeDock but on the Applications folder, since eyeDock shows only your preferred applications (to edit eyeDock, press "Manage" at the top left part of the Applications folder).
