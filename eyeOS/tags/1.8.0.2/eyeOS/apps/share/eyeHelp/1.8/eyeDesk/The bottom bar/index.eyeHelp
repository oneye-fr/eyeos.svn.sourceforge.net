In the bottom of your desktop you will see an opaque bar, which contains the minimized applications. You can maximize a minimized application by clicking on its bubble. If you click on a maximized application's bubble, the clicked application will appear on the top of all the opened applications. Finally, if you click on the top application's bubble, it will be minimized.

At the right part of the Bottom Bar you will see a small bar, sightly darker than the minimized applications bar, which contains the current hour and date. If you click on the date (which is in DD/MM format) a small calendar for the current month will appear. To close the calendar, just click again on the date. (see Illustration 10).
