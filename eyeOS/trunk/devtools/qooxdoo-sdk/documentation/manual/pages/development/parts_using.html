<p>Parts allow you partition your application into multiple Javascript files.There is an initial part, the <em>boot</em> part, that is loaded at application start-up. All other parts have  to be loaded explicitly in your application code.</p>
<p>To use parts in your application, you have to do two things:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>declare the parts in your application's <em>config.json</em> configuration file</li>
<li>load each part other than the boot part explicitly at suitable situations in your application code</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is an example:</p>
<p>Suppose you have a settings dialog in your application that is only needed occasionally. You want to save the memory footprint of the involved classes, and only load the dialog on demand when the user hits an &quot;Open Settings Dialog&quot; button during a session. If the user doesn't invoke the dialog, the necessary classes are not loaded and the application uses less memory in the browser. In all cases, application start-up is faster since less code has to be loaded initially.</p>

<span id="pages-parts-using-add-parts-to-your-config"></span><h3>Add Parts to your Config<a class="headerlink" href="#add-parts-to-your-config" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In your configuration file, add the following job (assuming you are using a standard GUI application with a name space of <em>custom</em>):</p>
<div class="highlight-javascript"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="s2">&quot;build-script&quot;</span><span class="o">:</span>

</pre></div>

<p>This will override the default <em>build-script</em> job, instructing the generator to generate JS files for the &quot;boot&quot; and the additional &quot;settings&quot; part (a single part may be made up of multiple JS files, depending on cross class dependencies with other parts). In the <em>boot</em> part, you are repeating the main <em>:ref:`include &lt;pages/tool/generator_config_ref#include&gt;`</em> list of class patterns for you application (the example mirrors this list of a standard GUI app). In the <em>settings</em> part, you carve out some top-level classes or name spaces that constitute the part you want to specify. In the example, this is just the name of the top-level dialog class.</p>

<p>The main thing to note here is that upon pressing the &quot;Open Settings Dialog&quot; button <em>qx.io.PartLoader.require</em> is invoked to make sure the <em>settings</em> part will be loaded (It doesn't hurt to invoke this method multiple times, as the PartLoader knows which parts have been loaded already).</p>
<p>The first argument to the <em>require</em> method is a list containing the parts you want to be loaded (just <em>&quot;settings&quot;</em> in our example). The second argument specifies the task that should be done once the part is successfully loaded. As you can see, the <em>custom.Settings</em> class, which is loaded with this part, is being instantiated.</p>
<p>These are the essential ingredients to set up and use parts in your application. For a general overview of parts in qooxdoo, see this <a class="reference internal" href="../tool/generator_config_articles.html#pages-tool-generator-config-articles-packages-key"><em>article</em></a>. For full details on the <em>packages</em> configuration key, see the <a class="reference internal" href="../tool/generator_config_ref.html#pages-tool-generator-config-ref-packages"><em>configuration reference</em></a>.

<span id="pages-parts-using-advanced-usage-part-collapsing"></span><h2>Advanced Usage: Part Collapsing<a class="headerlink" href="#advanced-usage-part-collapsing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This section reflects part collapsing as it is realized in qooxdoo version 0.8.3 and above.</p>
<div class="section" id="motivation-and-background">
<span id="pages-parts-using-motivation-and-background"></span><h3>Motivation and Background<a class="headerlink" href="#motivation-and-background" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>You as the application developer define <em>parts</em> to partition your application. qooxdoo's build system then partitions each part into <em>packages</em>, so that each part is made up of some of the set of all packages. Each package contains class code, and maybe some more information that pertains to it. So the classes making up a part are spread over a set of packages. Several parts can share one or more packages. This way you obtain maximum flexibility for loading parts in your application code. Whenever a part is requested through the <em>PartLoader</em> it checks which packages have already been loaded with earlier parts, and loads the remaining to make the part complete. No class is loaded twice, and no unnecessary classes are loaded with each part.</p>
<p>But there are situations where you might want to give up on this optimal distribution of classes across packages:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>when packages become <strong>too small</strong>; sometimes packages derived with the basic procedure turn out to be too small, and the benefit of loading no unnecessary classes is outweight by the fact that you have to make an additional net request to retrieve them.</li>
<li>when you know the <strong>order</strong> in which parts are loaded during run time in advance; then it makes sense to be &quot;greedy&quot; in retrieving as many classes as possible in a single package, as other parts needing the same classes of the (now bigger) package, but are known to load later, can rely on those classes being loaded already, without being affected by the extra classes that get loaded.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are situations where <em>part collapsing</em> is usefull, where packages are merged into one another. This is discussed in the next sections.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-packages-are-merged">
<span id="pages-parts-using-how-packages-are-merged"></span><h3>How Packages are Merged<a class="headerlink" href="#how-packages-are-merged" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><em>(This is a more theoretical section, but it is kept here for the time being; if you are only looking for how-to information, you can skip this section).</em></p>
<p>During what we call part collapsing, some packages are merged into others. That means the classes that are contained a source package are added to a target package, and the source package is deleted from all parts referencing it.</p>
<p>Obviously, it is crucial that the target package is referenced in all those parts where the source package was referenced originally, so that a part is not loosing the classes of the source package. This is taken care of by the selection process that for any given source package picks an appropriate target package. (Target packages are searched for in the set of already defined packages, and there are no new packages being constructed during the collapsing process).</p>
<p>After the source package has been merged into the target package, and has been removed from all parts, there are two cases:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>For parts that referenced both (source and target) package initially, there is no difference. The same set of classes is delivered, with the only difference that they come in one, as opposed to two, packages.</li>
<li>Parts that only reference the target package now reference more classes then they really need. But this should be acceptable, as either negligible (in the case of merging packages by size), since the additional weight is marginal; or as without negative effect (in the case of merging by load order), since the &quot;overladen&quot; package is supposed to be loaded earlier with some other part, and will already be available when this part is loaded.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="collapsing-by-package-size">
<span id="pages-parts-using-collapsing-by-package-size"></span><h3>Collapsing By Package Size<a class="headerlink" href="#collapsing-by-package-size" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Collapsing by package size is straight forward. You can specify a minimal package size (in KB) that applies to all packages of your application. If a package's size, and it is its <em>compiled</em> size that matteres here, is beneath this threshold the package will be merged into another. This avoids the problem of too much fragmentation of classes over packages, and trades optimally distributing the classes (to always load only necessary classes) for minimizing net requests (when loading packages for a part).</p>
<p>Collapsing by size is disabled by default. You enable it by specifying size attributes in your parts configuration:</p>
<div class="highlight-javascript"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="s2">&quot;packages&quot;</span> <span class="o">:</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="s2">&quot;sizes&quot;</span>    <span class="o">:</span>
  <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="s2">&quot;min-package&quot;</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="mi">20</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="s2">&quot;min-package-unshared&quot;</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="mi">10</span>
  <span class="p">},</span>
  <span class="p">...</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The <em>min-package</em> setting defines a general lower bound for package sizes, the <em>min-package-unshared</em>, which defaults to <em>min-package</em> if not given, allows you to refine this value specifically for those packages which pertain to only one part.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="collapsing-by-load-order">
<span id="pages-parts-using-collapsing-by-load-order"></span><h3>Collapsing By Load Order<a class="headerlink" href="#collapsing-by-load-order" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Collapsing by load order is always useful when you know in advance the order of at least some of your parts, as they are loaded during the app's run time. This is e.g. the case when you have a part that uses other parts to do its work (a big dialogue that has sub-controls like a tabview). The enclosing part is always loaded before its sub-parts can be used. Or there is a part that is only accessible after it has been enabled in another part. These situations can be captured by assigning a load order to (some of) your parts in your configuration.</p>
<div class="highlight-javascript"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="s2">&quot;packages&quot;</span> <span class="o">:</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="s2">&quot;parts&quot;</span>  <span class="o">:</span>

    <span class="p">},</span>
    <span class="s2">&quot;some-part&quot;</span> <span class="o">:</span>
    <span class="p">{</span>
      <span class="s2">&quot;include&quot;</span>   <span class="o">:</span> <span class="p">[</span> <span class="s2">&quot;app.Class1&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;app.Class2&quot;</span> <span class="p">],</span>
      <span class="s2">&quot;expected-load-order&quot;</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
    <span class="p">},</span>
    <span class="s2">&quot;other-part&quot;</span> <span class="o">:</span>
    <span class="p">{</span>
      <span class="s2">&quot;include&quot;</span>   <span class="o">:</span> <span class="p">[</span> <span class="s2">&quot;app.Class3&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;app.Class4&quot;</span> <span class="p">],</span>
      <span class="s2">&quot;expected-load-order&quot;</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="mi">2</span>
    <span class="p">},</span>
    <span class="p">...</span>
  <span class="p">},</span>
  <span class="p">...</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The <em>boot</em> part has always the load index 0, as it is always loaded first. The other parts that have a load index (1 and 2 in the example) will be collapsed with the expectation that they are loaded in this order. Parts that don't have an <em>expected-load-order</em> setting are not optimized by part collapsing, and there are no assumptions made as to when they are loaded during run time.</p>
<p>The important thing to note here is that the load order you define is <strong>not destructive</strong>. That means that parts are still self-contained and will continue to function <em>even if the expected load order is changed during run time</em>. In such cases, you only pay a penalty that classes are loaded with a part that are actually not used by it. But the overall functionality of your application is not negatively affected.</p>
