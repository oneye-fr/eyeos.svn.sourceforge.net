Requirements
	Server
		The main requirement for a new oneye installation is a PHP compatible Web Server with PHP 5 or higher.
		We recommend to use a server with Apache Web Server and PHP 5, but other webservers with PHP support are able to run oneye, as well.
		oneye has its own virtual file system and does not require a database to work. You will however need the capability of uploading files and directories to the webspace and to be able to change folder permissions.
		More help on getting a server installed along with oneye can be found at our Setup oneye
	Client (Web Browser)
		Your browser needs to be standards-compliant and support CSS. This includes the common modern browsers:
			* Mozilla Firefox 3 and higher
			* Internet Explorer 7 and higher
			* Apple Safari 3 and higher
			* Google Chrome 3 and higher
			* Opera 9 and higher (Please, use "Ctrl + Click" instead of right clicking.)
		Lower versions -like Safari 2- or other browsers -like Konqueror 3- may also work, but are not officially supported by the oneye Team.
		We strongly recommend Mozilla Firefox 3.6 to be able to use all oneye effects!

Installing oneye
	Once you have downloaded oneye, follow these instructions to install:
		* Extract the package you downloaded.
		* Copy the extracted files to your web directory (e.g. via FTP).
		* Start your web browser and browse to "installer/".
		* Follow the instructions the installer gives you.
		* Log into your new oneye system. (username: "root")
	Notes:
		* The oneye installation system comes with only a few files and some documentation. The installation process will decompress "package.eyepackage" and create the whole system structure.
		* If you wish to have oneye installed in your root dir (for example, to install it in www.yourdomain.com instead of www.yourdomain.com/oneye or similar), you only need to upload the files from the just extracted oneye/ folder.

Updating oneye
	The updater works with oneye 1.5 and higher.
		* Follow the instructions from "Installing oneye".
		* Click "Update oneye!" to start updating.

Office Support
	oneye includes a library (eyeConverter) to load and save Microsoft Office and Open Document file formats. It uses the OpenOffice.org suite as backend with an oneye macro, created for this purpose. Currently it is only thought to work on Linux and Windows servers.
	To install Office Support login as root user and start "System Preferences" (eyeControl).
	Now follow the instructions from the tab "Office Support" under "System".

Uninstalling oneye
	* Follow the instructions from "Installing oneye".
	* Select "Uninstall oneye" form the select box and click "Continue...".
	* Click "Yes" to confirm uninstalling oneye.
