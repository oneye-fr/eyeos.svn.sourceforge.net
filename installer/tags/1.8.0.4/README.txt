Requirements
	Server
		The main requirement for a new eyeOS Installation is a PHP compatible Web Server with PHP 5 or higher.
		We recommend to use a server with Apache Web Server and PHP 5, but other webservers with PHP support are able to run eyeOS, as well.
		eyeOS has its own virtual file system and does not require a database to work. You will however need the capability of uploading files and directories to the webspace and to be able to change folder permissions.
		More help on getting a server installed along with eyeOS can be found at our Setup eyeOS
	Client (Web Browser)
		Your browser needs to be standards-compliant and support CSS. This includes the common modern browsers:
			* Mozilla Firefox 2 and higher
			* Internet Explorer 6 and higher
			* Safari 3 and higher
			* Opera 9.5 and higher (It does not support right click, so you have to use "ctrl + click" instead!)
		We strongly recommend the latest version of Mozilla Firefox to be able to see and use all the eyeOS effects.

Installing eyeOS
	Once you have downloaded eyeOS, follow these instructions to install:
		* Extract the package you downloaded.
		* Copy the extracted files to your web directory (e.g. via FTP).
		* Start your web browser and browse to "installer/".
		* Follow the instructions the installer gives you.
		* Log into your new eyeOS system. (username: "root")
	Notes:
		* The eyeOS installation system comes with only a few files and some documentation. The installation process will decompress "package.eyepackage" and create the whole system structure.
		* If you wish to have eyeOS installed in your root dir (for example, to install it in www.yourdomain.com instead of www.yourdomain.com/eyeOS or similar), you only need to upload the files from the just extracted eyeOS/ folder.

Updating eyeOS
	The updater works with eyeOS 1.5 and higher.
		* Follow the instructions from "Installing eyeOS".
		* Click "Update eyeOS!" to start updating to eyeOS 1.8.

Office Support
	eyeOS includes a library (eyeConverter) to load and save Microsoft Office and Open Document file formats. It uses the OpenOffice.org suite as backend with an eyeOS macro, created for this purpose. Currently it is only thought to work on Linux and Windows servers.
	To install Office Support login as root user and start "System preferences" (eyeControl).
	Now follow the instructions from the tab "Office Support" under "System".

Uninstalling eyeOS
	The uninstaller only works with eyeOS 1.8.
		* Follow the instructions from "Installing eyeOS".
		* Select "Uninstall eyeOS" form the select box and click "Continue...".
		* Click "Yes" to confirm uninstalling eyeOS.
