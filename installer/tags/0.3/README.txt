Introduction
____________

In first place, welcome to eyeOS 1.0. You're about to discover a completely free,
Open Source Web Operating System.

The purpose of this User Manual is to provide documentation for new eyeOS users
for installing it and doing the first steps with it.


Requirements
____________

 - Server

The main requirement for a new eyeOS 1.0 Installation is a PHP compatible
Web Server with PHP >= 4.3.0.

We recommend to use a Unix server with Apache Web Server and PHP 5.x, but 
other webservers with PHP support should be able to get eyeOS installed too.

eyeOS 1.0 has it's own virtual file system, and does not require a database to work
You will however need the capability of uploading files and directories to the
webspace and to be able to change folder permissions.


  - Client (Web Browser)

Your browser needs to be standards-compliant and support CSS. This includes
the common modern browsers: Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari, Opera...

We strongly recommend a browser with a good standards support such as Mozilla
Firefox to be able to see and use all the eyeOS 1.0 effects.


Installation Instructions
_________________________

In first place, download the last eyeOS version available trought the website,
http://www.eyeos.org/downloads , and uncompress it.

Once uncompressed, you only need to upload the uncompressed eyeOS directory to 
your webspace using FTP or similar. 

If you wish to have eyeOS installed in your root dir (for example, to install it
in www.yourdomain.com instead of www.yourdomain.com/eyeOS or similar), you only 
need to upload the files inside the eyeOS/ folder just uncompressed.

NOTE: eyeOS installation system comes with only two files and some documentation.
The installation process will decompress the eyeOS.eyePackage file and create
the whole system structure.

When the upload finishes, just give full permissions to the uploaded files
and the folder that contains eyeOS. If you can't give permissions to the
folder which contains eyeOS, you may need to create a new folder and install it
there. (Some hosts do not allow to give full permissions to the root's path).

Once completed, you only have to run from your webbrowser the install.php file
and follow the screen instructions to end the installation.
