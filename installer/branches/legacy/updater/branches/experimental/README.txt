Thanks.

Introduction
____________

In first place, welcome to eyeOS 1.0. You're about to discover a completely free,
Open Source Web Operating System.

The purpose of this User Manual is to provide documentation for new eyeOS users
for installing it and doing the first steps with it.


Requirements
____________

 - Server

The main requirement for a new eyeOS 1.0 Installation is a PHP compatible
Web Server with PHP >= 4.3.0.

We recommend to use a Unix server with Apache Web Server and PHP 5.x, but 
other webservers with PHP support should be able to get eyeOS installed too.

eyeOS 1.0 has it's own virtual file system, and does not require a database to work
You will however need the capability of uploading files and directories to the
webspace and to be able to change folder permissions.


  - Client (Web Browser)

Your browser needs to be standards-compliant and support CSS. This includes
the common modern browsers: Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari, Opera...

We strongly recommend a browser with a good standards support such as Mozilla
Firefox to be able to see and use all the eyeOS 1.0 effects.


Updating Instructions
_________________________

1) In first place, uncompress the update package you have downloaded.

2) Once uncompressed, copy its contents (update.php and some other files) inside
the folder you have eyeOS installed.

3) Launch update.php from your browser, and follow the instructions.

4) Enjoy!
